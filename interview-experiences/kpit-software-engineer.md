* **Application Source**: HR Shortlisting

---

## Interview Process

### 1. **Technical Interview**

* **Duration**: ~60 minutes
* **Format**: Technical discussion
* **Initial Context**:

  * The interview began on a **negative note**, as the interviewer repeatedly focused on **C/C++ and embedded/automobile experience**, which I clearly do not have.
  * This information was already evident in my resume, despite which I was shortlisted by HR.

* **Questions Asked**:

  * Introduction and overview of professional experience.
  * Detailed discussion on work experience so far.
  * What work I have done using **Rust**.
  * Current project details and responsibilities.
  * Explain **ownership and borrowing** in Rust with examples.
  * What are **Smart Pointers**?

    * Explanation of `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc`.
  * Trait-based design question:

    * Define a `Shape` trait.
    * Implement it for different shape structs.
    * Dynamically call a `compute_area` method.
    * Explain why this approach is useful (polymorphism, extensibility).
  * Write core logic to **reverse a number**.
  * **Error handling in Rust**:

    * Using `struct` and `enum` with examples.
  * **Async Rust**:

    * `async` / `await`
    * What is `tokio`
    * Channels in Rust
  * Explain **zero-cost abstractions** in Rust.
  * Explain the **interior mutability pattern**.
  * Explain about **macros in Rust**.
  * Discussion on **unsafe Rust** and when/why it is required.

* **Discussion Points**:

  * The discussion covered a wide range of Rust fundamentals and advanced topics.
  * All questions were answered with **clear explanations and practical examples**.

## Key Rust Topics Covered

* Ownership and Borrowing
* Smart Pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`)
* Traits and dynamic dispatch
* Error handling with `Result` and `enum`
* Async Rust (`tokio`, channels)
* Zero-cost abstractions
* Interior mutability (`RefCell`, `Mutex`)
* Unsafe Rust

---

## Outcome

* **Result**: Rejected
* **Feedback Received**:

  * Rejection was due to **lack of embedded systems and automobile domain experience**.
* **Personal Reflections**:

  * The rejection criteria were already visible from my resume and could have been filtered during HR shortlisting.
  * The technical discussion itself was thorough and Rust-focused.
  * Time and effort could have been saved for both sides with clearer role expectations upfront.

## Tips for Future Candidates

* Clarify **domain expectations** (embedded/automotive vs backend/systems) before the interview.
* Even Rust roles in automotive companies may heavily expect **C/C++ and embedded experience**.
* Be prepared for domain-driven rejection despite strong technical performance.
* Ensure alignment between **HR screening** and **interviewer expectations** before proceeding.
