* **Role**: Rust Developer
* **Location**: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, In Office
* **Interview Date**: Jan, 2025
* **Experience Level**: 2 years in Rust, Solana
* **Application Source**: Referral

## Interview Process

1. **Round 1 – Technical Interview**

   * **Duration**: 60 minutes
   * **Format**: Discussion
   * **Questions Asked**:

     * How does Rust ensure memory safety without a garbage collector?
     * Questions on concurrency with Rust: `async`/`await`, Tokio, `parking_lot` crate, etc.
     * How Rust handles errors – kinds of errors, `Result`, `Option`
     * What are Smart Pointers and Interior Mutability? Differences between `Arc` and `Rc`
     * Zero-Cost Abstractions, Pinning in Rust
     * Generics in Rust, and the purpose of the `From` and `Into` traits
     * `Copy` and `Clone`, `Cow` in Rust – why some types implement `Copy` by default while others don't
     * Pattern Matching and Enums, `unsafe` Rust
     * Discussion around previous work
     * In a program, what is the difference between `invoke` and `invoke_signed`, and when to use them?
     * What is Anchor? Why is it used, and what problems does it solve?
   * **Discussion Points**: Covered all core concepts of Rust, Solana, and Anchor with proper examples. You should understand the why, what, and how.

2. **Round 2 – Technical Interview**

   * **Duration**: 60 minutes
   * **Format**: Discussion
   * **Questions Asked**:

     * Rust ownership and borrowing – how it differs from other languages
     * How garbage collection works in other languages, and why Rust eliminates the need for it
     * Error handling in Rust – `Option`, `Result`, and the `?` operator
     * How would you design a transaction history component – frontend, backend, database, blockchain data access, etc.
     * Explain how a transaction occurs on the Solana network – creation, execution, transaction states
     * How is solana able to execute transactions parallely.
     * What challenges are faced by users and developers on Solana
     * What are L2s on Ethereum and how do they work
     * Why don't we have L2s on Solana
   * **Discussion Points**: In-depth coverage of Rust, Solana, and Anchor with real-world examples. A good understanding of system design was expected.

3. **Round 3 – HR Interview**

   * **Duration**: 30 minutes
   * **Format**: Behavioral Questions, Salary Discussion
   * **Discussion Points**: Team collaboration, conflict resolution

## Key Rust Topics Covered

* All core Rust concepts with real-world examples
* System design fundamentals
* Blockchain basics

## Outcome

* **Result**: Offer Extended
* **Feedback Received**: No
* **Personal Reflections**: I was able to explain everything clearly and answered almost all questions. Performed decently in Round 2—struggled a bit during the system design discussion, but overall it went well.

## Tips for Future Candidates

* Focus on core Rust concepts and practice explaining them clearly with examples
* Learn how to design systems and practice articulating them
* Understand the why, what, and how behind each concept—especially when applying for blockchain-focused roles
