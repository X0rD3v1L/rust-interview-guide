## Overview

* **Company**: SquarePoint Capital
* **Role**: Software Developer - Rust Developer
* **Location**: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, In Office
* **Interview Date**: April, 2025
* **Experience Level**: 4 years of software development experience, with proficiency in React and Rust
* **Application Source**: Naukri

## Interview Process

1. **Round 1 – Technical Interview F2F**

   * **Duration**: 60 minutes

   * **Format**: Discussion, Coding

   * **Questions Asked**:

     * Detailed discussion on my experience with Rust — projects, frameworks, and crates I've worked with.
     * Explain Ownership and Borrowing in Rust.
     * How are constants defined in Rust? Where is memory allocated for them?
     * Differences between the `Copy` and `Clone` traits.
     * What are Smart Pointers? Explain each one, especially the difference between `Rc` and `Arc`.
     * What is `unsafe` Rust and why is it necessary?

     Then the interviewer gave me his keyboard. The coding question was displayed on the HackerRank platform.
     It had two parts. Once Part A was completed, Part B became visible.

     **Part A**:

     * Implement a basic key-value store with `get`, `put`, and `delete` operations.

     **Part B**:

     * Add transaction functionality with commands:
       `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
       (Same as: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/279913/bloomberg-onsite-key-value-store-with-tr-kcrv/](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/279913/bloomberg-onsite-key-value-store-with-tr-kcrv/))

     I wasn’t fully comfortable with some built-in methods of `HashMap` in Rust. The interviewer was supportive and encouraged discussion. I covered about 80% of the problem before the time ran out.

     **Solution**: [GitHub - kv\_store\_with\_transactions.rs](https://github.com/X0rD3v1L/RusticJourney/blob/main/machine-coding-questions/src/bin/kv_store_with_transactions.rs)

   * **Discussion Points**: Core Rust concepts, Rust projects, and implementation ability.

## Key Rust Topics Covered

* Ownership and Borrowing
* Copy and Clone Traits
* Memory Management in Rust

## Outcome

* **Result**: Rejected
* **Feedback Received**: No
* **Personal Reflections**: Although I couldn’t complete the problem in time, the experience was insightful and encouraging.

## Tips for Future Candidates

* Don’t rush for optimal solutions — start with brute force, then optimize.
* Be thorough with Rust’s core concepts and standard library.
